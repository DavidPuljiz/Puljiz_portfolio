abstract = {The metaverse is an immersive virtual space that enables users to meet each other virtually as an avatar and to interact with the virtual environment whatever their location. The metaverse approach is mainly based on the virtual reality (VR) technology enhanced with multiplayer capability. VR enables, due to its high immersive and interactive capabilities, a realistic experience of complex and abstract technical systems which leads to the support of the human cognitive abilities in observing their behavior. The advantages of VR have been recognized by the industry in the last few years. As a result, numerous industrial companies worldwide have founded initiatives with research institutions and start-ups to investigate the application of VR and the metaverse. This paper presents and discusses the implementation and the application of an industrial metaverse approach based on VR for the design review of a pharmaceutical vial filling machine.}

abstract = {Animals use stochastic search strategies to find a potential nest or to localize the food source. Animals do not rely much on the environmental cues or their sensory inputs. Since their cognitive capabilities are rather limited, search strategies are usually simplistic and stochastic. And yet such simple search strategies result in high efficiency in finding potential targets in limited time intervals. Similar problems with perception of the environment and limited computational power and sensory inputs are observed on the mobile robots used in search scenarios. In spite of their limitations, such robotic systems usually perform deterministic search strategies which heavily depend on environmental cues and sensory input. The research question we are addressing in this paper is which stochastic search strategy has the best performance in terms of area coverage and can stochastic search strategies outperform deterministic search strategies.}
