abstract: Animals use stochastic search strategies to find a potential nest or to
  localize the food source. Animals do not rely much on the environmental cues or
  their sensory inputs. Since their cognitive capabilities are rather limited, search
  strategies are usually simplistic and stochastic. And yet such simple search strategies
  result in high efficiency in finding potential targets in limited time intervals.
  Similar problems with perception of the environment and limited computational power
  and sensory inputs are observed on the mobile robots used in search scenarios. In
  spite of their limitations, such robotic systems usually perform deterministic search
  strategies which heavily depend on environmental cues and sensory input. The research
  question we are addressing in this paper is which stochastic search strategy has
  the best performance in terms of area coverage and can stochastic search strategies
  outperform deterministic search strategies.
