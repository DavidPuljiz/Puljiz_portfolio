 abstract = {Animals use stochastic search strategies to find a potential nest or to localize the food source. Animals do not rely much on the environmental cues or their sensory inputs. Since their cognitive capabilities are rather limited, search strategies are usually simplistic and stochastic. And yet such simple search strategies result in high efficiency in finding potential targets in limited time intervals. Similar problems with perception of the environment and limited computational power and sensory inputs are observed on the mobile robots used in search scenarios. In spite of their limitations, such robotic systems usually perform deterministic search strategies which heavily depend on environmental cues and sensory input. The research question we are addressing in this paper is which stochastic search strategy has the best performance in terms of area coverage and can stochastic search strategies outperform deterministic search strategies.},
