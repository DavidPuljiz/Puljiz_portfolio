 abstract = {The metaverse is an immersive virtual space that enables users to meet each other virtually as an avatar and to interact with the virtual environment whatever their location. The metaverse approach is mainly based on the virtual reality (VR) technology enhanced with multiplayer capability. VR enables, due to its high immersive and interactive capabilities, a realistic experience of complex and abstract technical systems which leads to the support of the human cognitive abilities in observing their behavior. The advantages of VR have been recognized by the industry in the last few years. As a result, numerous industrial companies worldwide have founded initiatives with research institutions and start-ups to investigate the application of VR and the metaverse. This paper presents and discusses the implementation and the application of an industrial metaverse approach based on VR for the design review of a pharmaceutical vial filling machine.},
